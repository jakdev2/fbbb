flappy bird, but bad

very simple recreation of flappy bird by .gears on c#, with the unity game engine

aka circle jump between rectangles because there's no flap or bird

made with a little help of github copilot

# compile

basically just download unity lts 2020 and import the project (source code), on unity hub download the module according to what platform you wanna build to (linux, android, mac, ios, windows, etc) and then open the project, go to file>build settings and configure the build (i leave the configuration as default for the official builds)
